# 🧠 NLP_With_DL_DeepDive  
*A personal journey through modern Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning*

Hi there! 👋 I'm Samhita, and this repository is a reflection of my deep dive into the world of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using deep learning.

When I first started exploring NLP, I wanted to go beyond theory — to **build**, **experiment**, and truly understand how models learn language. This collection of projects represents that hands-on journey — from simple word embeddings to advanced sequence modeling with RNNs and PyTorch.

Each folder here tells a story — a problem I explored, a model I built, and a lesson I learned along the way.

## 🧭 What You'll Find Here

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `word2vec_skipgram/` | My first step into representation learning — building the Skip-Gram model with negative sampling from scratch |
| `vectorspeak_word2vec_skipgram/` | An extension to compare how different architectures learn embeddings — because visualizing words is powerful |
| `ffnn_sentiment_analysis_numpy_pytorch/` | A practical dive into sentiment analysis using Feedforward Neural Networks — comparing pure NumPy and PyTorch versions |
| `ner_rnn_conll2003_pytorch/` | A full-scale sequence labeling challenge — implementing 7 RNN variants for Named Entity Recognition on CoNLL-2003 |
